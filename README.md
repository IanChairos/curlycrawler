CurlyCrawler
============

Something I did about a year ago - 2013...
I used that to crawl through pages from a date service and parse the information into DB.
I used my login in order to see more relevant search results. I had this in Nette FW,
so i could refine the search and see photos and more interests. It basicaly saved a lot of
time clicking <next> button and matching my interests :)


p.s. it could use some refactoring and refoldering ;)
